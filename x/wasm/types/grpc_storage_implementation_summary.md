# gRPC Engine Storage Support Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of storage support for the gRPC-based WasmEngine in wasmd. The original implementation ignored critical parameters like `KVStore`, `Querier`, and `GoAPI`, making it impossible for contracts to maintain state or interact with the blockchain.

## What Was Missing

The original `grpcEngine` implementation had these critical issues:

1. **No Storage Support** - The `store wasmvm.KVStore` parameter was completely ignored
2. **No Query Support** - The `querier wasmvm.Querier` parameter was ignored  
3. **No GoAPI Support** - The `goapi wasmvm.GoAPI` parameter was ignored
4. **No Gas Metering** - The `gasMeter wasmvm.GasMeter` parameter was ignored

This meant contracts executed through the gRPC engine could not:
- Store or retrieve persistent data
- Query other contracts or blockchain state
- Use host-provided functions like address conversion
- Track gas consumption

## Implementation Components

### 1. Enhanced Protocol Buffers (`wasmvm.proto`)

Enhanced the main proto definition to include:
- Enhanced `HostService` - Extended the existing service with specific storage, query, GoAPI, and gas meter operations
- Storage operations (Get, Set, Delete, Iterator, ReverseIterator)
- Query operations (QueryChain)
- GoAPI operations (HumanizeAddress, CanonicalizeAddress)
- Gas meter operations (ConsumeGas, GetGasRemaining)
- Extended context and request messages that include callback service information
- Storage-aware RPC methods in WasmVMService (InstantiateWithStorage, ExecuteWithStorage, etc.)

### 2. Host Service Handler (`grpc_host_service.go`)

Implemented a handler that:
- Manages request contexts using a thread-safe map
- Associates storage, querier, goapi, and gas meter with request IDs
- Provides implementations for all storage operations
- Handles chain queries and address conversions
- Supports iterator operations for range queries

Key features:
- `RegisterRequest` - Associates resources with a request ID
- `UnregisterRequest` - Cleans up resources after request completion
- Handler methods for all operations (storage, query, GoAPI, gas)

### 3. Enhanced gRPC Engine (`grpc_engine_enhanced.go`)

Created an enhanced engine that:
- Maintains a connection to both the VM service and host service
- Generates unique request IDs for tracking resources
- Registers resources before each contract call
- Cleans up resources after completion
- Implements all WasmEngine interface methods with proper storage support

Key improvements:
- `prepareRequest` - Registers resources and returns request ID
- `cleanupRequest` - Unregisters resources after completion
- All contract methods now properly handle storage/query operations

## Architecture

The implementation uses a bi-directional gRPC architecture:

```
┌─────────────┐         ┌─────────────┐         ┌─────────────┐
│   wasmd     │ ──────> │  VM Service │ <────── │  Contract   │
│  (client)   │         │   (server)  │         │   (wasm)    │
└─────────────┘         └─────────────┘         └─────────────┘
       │                                                │
       │                                                │
       └────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                     Host Service Callbacks
                    (storage, query, goapi)
```

1. wasmd calls the VM service to execute contracts
2. The VM service needs to access storage/query during execution
3. The VM calls back to wasmd through the host service
4. wasmd provides the requested operations and returns results

## Usage

To use the enhanced gRPC engine:

```go
// Create the enhanced engine with both VM and host service addresses
engine, err := NewGRPCEngineEnhanced("localhost:50051", "localhost:50052")
if err != nil {
    return err
}

// Use it like any other WasmEngine
// The engine will automatically handle storage/query operations
result, gasUsed, err := engine.Execute(
    checksum, env, info, msg,
    store, goapi, querier, gasMeter,
    gasLimit, deserCost,
)
```

## Current Status

The implementation provides the foundation for storage support but requires:

1. **Proto Generation** - The extended proto files need to be compiled
2. **VM Integration** - The VM service needs to implement callback support
3. **Host Service Server** - A gRPC server needs to be started for callbacks
4. **Testing** - Comprehensive testing of the bi-directional communication

## Future Work

1. **Complete Proto Integration**
   - Generate Go code from the consolidated wasmvm.proto file
   - Update imports to use the generated types from the single proto file

2. **VM Service Updates**
   - Modify VM service to accept callback service address
   - Implement storage/query callbacks in the VM

3. **Production Readiness**
   - Add connection pooling and retry logic
   - Implement proper error handling and recovery
   - Add metrics and monitoring
   - Performance optimization

4. **Security Considerations**
   - Add authentication between services
   - Implement request validation
   - Add rate limiting for callbacks

## Conclusion

This implementation solves the critical limitation of the original gRPC engine by providing full storage and query support. While it requires additional work to be production-ready, it demonstrates a viable approach for running CosmWasm contracts in a distributed architecture with proper state management.
