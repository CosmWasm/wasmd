# Wasm Module

This should be a brief overview of the functionality

## Configuration

You can add the following section to `config/app.toml`:

```toml
[wasm]
# This is the maximum sdk gas (wasm and storage) that we allow for any x/wasm "smart" queries
query_gas_limit = 300000
# This defines the memory size for Wasm modules that we can keep cached to speed-up instantiation
# The value is in MiB not bytes
memory_cache_size = 300
```

The values can also be set via CLI flags on with the `start` command:
```shell script
--wasm.memory_cache_size uint32     Sets the size in MiB (NOT bytes) of an in-memory cache for wasm modules. Set to 0 to disable. (default 100)
--wasm.query_gas_limit uint         Set the max gas that can be spent on executing a query with a Wasm contract (default 3000000)
```

## Events

### Overview
A number of events are returned to allow good indexing of the transactions from smart contracts.

Every call to Instantiate or Execute will be tagged with the info on the contract that was executed and who executed it.
It should look something like this (with different addresses). The module is always `wasm`, and `code_id` is only present
when Instantiating a contract, so you can subscribe to new instances, it is omitted on Execute. There is also an `action` tag
which is auto-added by the Cosmos SDK and has a value of either `store-code`, `instantiate` or `execute` depending on which message
was sent:

```json
{
    "Type": "message",
    "Attr": [
        {
            "key": "module",
            "value": "wasm"
        },
        {
            "key": "action",
            "value": "instantiate"
        },
        {
            "key": "signer",
            "value": "cosmos1vx8knpllrj7n963p9ttd80w47kpacrhuts497x"
        },
        {
            "key": "code_id",
            "value": "1"
        },
        {
            "key": "_contract_address",
            "value": "cosmos14hj2tavq8fpesdwxxcu44rty3hh90vhujrvcmstl4zr3txmfvw9s4hmalr"
        }
    ]
}
```

If any funds were transferred to the contract as part of the message, or if the contract released funds as part of it's executions,
it will receive the typical events associated with sending tokens from bank. In this case, we instantiate the contract and
provide a initial balance in the same `MsgInstantiateContract`. We see the following events in addition to the above one:

```json
[
    {
        "Type": "transfer",
        "Attr": [
            {
                "key": "recipient",
                "value": "cosmos14hj2tavq8fpesdwxxcu44rty3hh90vhujrvcmstl4zr3txmfvw9s4hmalr"
            },
            {
                "key": "sender",
                "value": "cosmos1ffnqn02ft2psvyv4dyr56nnv6plllf9pm2kpmv"
            },
            {
                "key": "amount",
                "value": "100000denom"
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

Finally, the contract itself can emit a "custom event" on Execute only (not on Init).
There is one event per contract, so if one contract calls a second contract, you may receive
one event for the original contract and one for the re-invoked contract. All attributes from the contract are passed through verbatim,
and we add a `_contract_address` attribute that contains the actual contract that emitted that event.
Here is an example from the escrow contract successfully releasing funds to the destination address:

```json
{
    "Type": "wasm",
    "Attr": [
        {
            "key": "_contract_address",
            "value": "cosmos14hj2tavq8fpesdwxxcu44rty3hh90vhujrvcmstl4zr3txmfvw9s4hmalr"
        },
        {
            "key": "action",
            "value": "release"
        },
        {
            "key": "destination",
            "value": "cosmos14k7v7ms4jxkk2etmg9gljxjm4ru3qjdugfsflq"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Pulling this all together

We will invoke an escrow contract to release to the designated beneficiary.
The escrow was previously loaded with `100000denom` (from the above example).
In this transaction, we send `5000denom` along with the `MsgExecuteContract`
and the contract releases the entire funds (`105000denom`) to the beneficiary.

We will see all the following events, where you should be able to reconstruct the actions
(remember there are two events for each transfer). We see (1) the initial transfer of funds
to the contract, (2) the contract custom event that it released funds (3) the transfer of funds
from the contract to the beneficiary and (4) the generic x/wasm event stating that the contract
was executed (which always appears, while 2 is optional and has information as reliable as the contract):

```json
[
    {
        "Type": "transfer",
        "Attr": [
            {
                "key": "recipient",
                "value": "cosmos14hj2tavq8fpesdwxxcu44rty3hh90vhujrvcmstl4zr3txmfvw9s4hmalr"
            },
            {
                "key": "sender",
                "value": "cosmos1zm074khx32hqy20hlshlsd423n07pwlu9cpt37"
            },
            {
                "key": "amount",
                "value": "5000denom"
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "Type": "wasm",
        "Attr": [
            {
                "key": "_contract_address",
                "value": "cosmos14hj2tavq8fpesdwxxcu44rty3hh90vhujrvcmstl4zr3txmfvw9s4hmalr"
            },
            {
                "key": "action",
                "value": "release"
            },
            {
                "key": "destination",
                "value": "cosmos14k7v7ms4jxkk2etmg9gljxjm4ru3qjdugfsflq"
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "Type": "transfer",
        "Attr": [
            {
                "key": "recipient",
                "value": "cosmos14k7v7ms4jxkk2etmg9gljxjm4ru3qjdugfsflq"
            },
            {
                "key": "sender",
                "value": "cosmos14hj2tavq8fpesdwxxcu44rty3hh90vhujrvcmstl4zr3txmfvw9s4hmalr"
            },
            {
                "key": "amount",
                "value": "105000denom"
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "Type": "message",
        "Attr": [
            {
                "key": "module",
                "value": "wasm"
            },
            {
                "key": "action",
                "value": "execute"
            },
            {
                "key": "signer",
                "value": "cosmos1zm074khx32hqy20hlshlsd423n07pwlu9cpt37"
            },
            {
                "key": "_contract_address",
                "value": "cosmos14hj2tavq8fpesdwxxcu44rty3hh90vhujrvcmstl4zr3txmfvw9s4hmalr"
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

A note on this format. This is what we return from our module. However, it seems to me that many events with the same `Type`
get merged together somewhere along the stack, so in this case, you *may* end up with one "transfer" event with the info for
both transfers. Double check when evaluating the event logs, I will document better with more experience, especially when I
find out the entire path for the events.

### Keeper Events
In addition to message events, the wasm keeper will produce events when the following methods are called (or any method which ends up calling them)

#### Reply
`reply` is only called from keeper after processing the submessage

| Type  | Attribute Key     | Attribute Value   | Note |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|------|
| reply | _contract_address | {contractAddress} |      |

#### Sudo
`Sudo` allows priviledged access to a contract. This can never be called by an external tx, but only by another native Go module directly.

| Type | Attribute Key     | Attribute Value   | Note |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|------|
| sudo | _contract_address | {contractAddress} |      |

#### PinCode
`PinCode` pins the wasm contract in wasmvm cache.

| Type     | Attribute Key | Attribute Value | Note |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|------|
| pin_code | code_id       | {codeID}        |      |

#### UnpinCode

| Type       | Attribute Key | Attribute Value | Note |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|------|
| unpin_code | code_id       | {codeID}        |      |

#### SetContractAdmin
| Type                  | Attribute Key     | Attribute Value    | Note |
|-----------------------|-------------------|--------------------|------|
| update_contract_admin | _contract_address | {contract_address} |      |
| update_contract_admin | new_admin_address | {adminAddress}     |      |

#### SetAccessConfig
| Type                      | Attribute Key   | Attribute Value | Note |
