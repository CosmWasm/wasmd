> [!WARNING]
> This is alpha software, do not run on a production system. Notably, we currently provide no migration path
> not even "dump state and restart" to move to future versions.
> We will have a stable v0.x version before the final v1.0.0 version with the same API as the v1.0 version
> in order to run last testnets and manual testing on it. We have not yet committed to that version number.
> wasmd 0.25 will support Cosmos SDK 0.44/0.45 and should be quite close to a final API, minus some minor details.
>
> Our v1.0.0 release plans were also delayed by upstream release cycles, and we have continued to refine APIs while we can.
