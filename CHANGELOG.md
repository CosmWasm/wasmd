- Upgrade to cosmos-sdk proto 0.47.x [\#1148](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/issues/1148)

### Notable changes:
- If you are not coming from v0.32.0, please see the "Notables changes" below, first. Especially about CometBFT.
- IBC-Go is a new major version including the "hucklebery" security fix. See [v7.0.1](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v7.0.1).
- SDK 47 support is a big step from the SDK 45 version supported before. Make sure to read the upgrade guide for the SDK
  before applying any changes. Links below. 
- Some advice from working with SDK 47 that may affect you, too:    
  - The SDK version includes some key store migration for the CLI. Make sure you backup your private keys before 
    testing this! You can not switch back to v0.45 afaik
  - Take care that you use the goleveldb version used in the SDK. A transitive dependency may change it which caused 
    failing queries on a running server: `Error: rpc error: code = InvalidArgument desc = failed to load state at height 1; version does not exist (latest height: 1): invalid request`
    Ensure this in go.mod:
    `github.com/syndtr/goleveldb => github.com/syndtr/goleveldb v1.0.1-0.20210819022825-2ae1ddf74ef7`
  - With custom modules, use the new proto-builder version (Makefile) to let proto types register with the correct registry
  - Ensure that all `ParameterChangeProposal` are completed before the upgrade or migrate them to `v1.gov`. SDK and wasm 
    modules execute a migration before so that these proposals would not have an affect.
  - Attribute keys/ values in events are strings and not bytes in CometBFT. This may break clients
  - CLI: `add-genesis-account`, `gentx,add-genesis-account`, `collect-gentxs` and others are now under genesis command as parent
  - CLI: `--broadcast-mode block` was removed. You need to query the result for a TX with `wasmd q tx <hash>` instead

### Migration notes:
- This release contains a [state migration](./x/wasm/migrations/v2) for the wasmd module that stores 
  the params in the module store.
- SDK v0.47 comes with a lot of api/state braking changes to previous versions. Please see their [upgrade guide](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/UPGRADING.md#v047x)
  which contains a lot of helpful details.
- Please read the [migration guide](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/tree/v7.0.0/docs/migrations) for IBC-Go [v7.0.0](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v7.0.0) carefully

## [v0.28.0](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/tree/v0.28.0) (2022-07-29)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/compare/v0.27.0...v0.28.0)

**API Breaking**

No

**Fixed Bugs**

- Fix: Make events in reply completely determinisitic by stripping out anything coming from Cosmos SDK (not CosmWasm codebase) [\#917](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/pull/917) ([assafmo](https://github.com/assafmo))

Migration notes:

* Contracts can no longer parse events from any calls except if they call another contract (or instantiate it, migrate it, etc).
The main issue here is likely "Custom" queries from a blockchain, which want to send info (eg. how many tokens were swapped).
Since those custom bindings are maintained by the chain, they can use the data field to pass any deterministic information
back to the contract. We recommend using JSON encoding there with some documented format the contracts can parse out easily.
* For possible non-determinism issues, we also sort all attributes in events. Better safe than sorry.
